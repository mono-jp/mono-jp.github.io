Hey everyone! The Mono team is pleased to announce that [we are a
mentor organization in the Google Summer of Code
2015!](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/mono)
This is the eleventh year of Summer of Code for us, and we're really
excited to work with a new group of students.

This is a great opportunity to spend the summer with a great community
working on cutting edge open-source C# tools and frameworks. You can
hone your development skills by working on large and complex codebases
with experienced mentors, and get paid for your hard work too.

If you're an [eligible
student](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page#2._Whos_eligible_to_participate_as_a),
the application period runs from [March
15-27](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2015). But
don't let that stop you from starting on your proposals!  Feel free to
introduce yourself to the community and mentors, talk about your
ideas, and do some preliminary research to make your proposal as
strong as it can be. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, you
could even get started on some quick bugfixes and patches to show off
your skills; while this isn't required, it is really helpful in seeing
how you work and getting your name out in the community. Show us how
excited you are about coding!

Same as last year, our project ideas and rules are available on our
[GSoC ideas page](http://mono-project.com/Gsoc), and we'll be updating
the list as we come up with new ideas. Don't let these ideas limit you
though; if you have your own idea for a great project for the summer,
put it in a proposal and send it our way. Or, if you can't decide, you
can always submit multiple proposals. Keep in mind, though, quality is
better than quantity in this case.

Our project mailing lists should be your first stop for questions
about contributing to Mono. There are [many
lists](http://mono-project.com/Mailing_Lists) for different topics,
but the main ones are
[mono](http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list),
[mono-devel](http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-devel-list)
and
[monodevelop-devel](http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodevelop-devel-list). For
external projects, you should also contact the developers in their
project mailing lists.

And of course IRC is where you can find everyone online, on the
[irc.gnome.org](http://irc.gnome.org/) server. There's the #mono channel for general Mono
discussions, #monodev for Mono development, #monodevelop for
MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio, and #monosoc for Summer of
Code-specific questions and saying "Hi" to your fellow students. Hang
around a while after asking a question - we have mentors in many
timezones so they may be asleep or busy when you visit.

If you're not a student, you can participate in Summer of Code by
helping the students feel welcome in our community! Or, if you're
interested in mentoring C# tools and libraries under the Mono
umbrella, send an email to the Mono GSoC administrator at
[soc@xamarin.com](mailto:soc@xamarin.com).

To stay up to date with the applications process and the work of our
students, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/monosoc) and

luck, and here's to another great summer of coding!
