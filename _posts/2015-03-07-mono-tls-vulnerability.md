A TLS impersonation attack was discovered in Mono's TLS stack by
researchers at Inria
([SKIP-TLS](https://www.smacktls.com/#skip). During checks on our TLS
stack, we have discovered two further issues which we have fixed -
SSLv2 support, and vulnerability to
[FREAK](https://www.smacktls.com/#freak). These vulnerabilities affect
basically every Mono version ever released.

All three issues should be addressed in the following patches:

- Patch to address [SKIP TLS vulnerability](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/1509226c41d74194c146deb173e752b8d3cdeec4)
- Patch to address [FREAK vulnerability](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/9c38772f094168d8bfd5bc73bf8925cd04faad10)
- [Removal of SSLv2](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/b371da6b2d68b4cdd0f21d6342af6c42794f998b)

These patches should apply to all Mono versions from 3.4.0 or so
onwards. The FREAK patch requires slight modification
in order to apply to Mono releases prior to 3.x [patch for Mono
pre-3.4](https://gist.github.com/directhex/728af6f96d1b8c976659)
should work for these users. The Impersonation patch requires slight
modification to apply to Mono releases prior to 3.4 [patch for Mono
pre-3.4](https://gist.github.com/directhex/f8c6e67f551d8a608154)
should work for these users.

Alternatively, this is fixed in Mono 3.12.1 and higher:
[mono-3.12.1.tar.bz2](https://download.mono-project.com/sources/mono/mono-3.12.1.tar.bz2)

Mono's github repository contains the bug fix for all supported branches
(master, mono-4.0.0-branch, mono-3.12.0-branch, mono-3.10.0-branch).

Linux and Mac downloads from
[mono-project.com](http://www.mono-project.com) have been updated to
3.12.1 - the Windows release will take another day or two.

Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of Mono versions in use in supported
distributions, and the patches they require for full coverage.
