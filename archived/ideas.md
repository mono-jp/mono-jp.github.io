Ideas
=====

Libraries
---------

-   Implement a Mail API, similar to Camel or JavaMail (Camel has significant architecture features that are required on a real mailer).<br/>
    You can check the current C [Camel implementation](http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/rview.cgi?dir=evolution%2Fcamel).<br/>
    Such an implementation could be used both with Microsoft .NET and Mono.

-   Interfacing to Multimedia systems. You might want to look into the Quicktime API. I know [Vladimir](mailto:vladimir@ximian.com) has researched the problem before.
