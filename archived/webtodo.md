Web Site
========

Migration
---------

-   Add redirects for all the old urls, to the new urls.

-   Switch the DNS.

-   Add a redirect for eliminating the "base" url.

-   Sanitize the naming conventions (move each file to its proper name)
    -   See list of pages ImportedPages here

RSS
---

Need to find a way of producing the RSS and posting it to the proper template.

Layout
------

Add links to Blogs, Downloads, Screenshots at the top.

Possibly move the current navigation bar to one of the boxes on the left.

Replace the links of \`navigation' with the common Mono destinations: Downloads, Blogs, Screenshots, etc.

Organization
------------

Need to find a way of linking all the pages in ImportedPages].

Content
=======

Missing: Contact on the main page.

Missing: the various "News" items from the old web site have not been migrated.

Unify all the TODO items that are sprinkled over the site into a Template, called "TODO:XXXX", then, list this on the Tasks page which is linking to all the TODOs. This allows the same TODO to be present in more than one place: a unified location, and the per-component place.

Needed
------

List of various components that work with Mono or are certified with Mono.

-   Libraries
-   Components
-   Compilers

List of the components that we ship \*today\* and have a page per-component to document it.

-   Link the page to the front-site, as part of the "Platforms" or something in developers.

List of various components that work with Gtk# or are certified with Gtk#

Platform Support
----------------

-   create per-architecture pages that describe the port, currently we have one for PPC
-   create per-OS page that describes the port.

Database pages
--------------

Currently the database pages follow more or less the same format, we should audit them to contain the same information.

Content Audit
=============

The content on many of these pages is fairly outdated, we must review each page, and track the audited pages, with a time stamp of the last audit on a centralized location (we could use the ImportedPages for this).

FAQs
----

The FAQs are extremely old and must be updated to reflect new information.

Wondering whether we should also shuffle them around a bit.

HOWTOs
------

The contributor HOWTO is very outdated.

Update the TODO list of tasks of things to do with Mono, for Mono.

Update the list of Ideas of projects for people.
