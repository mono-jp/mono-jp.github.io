Mono Documentation Improvement Project
======================================

 Although most of the concepts from the Microsoft.NET Framework can be applied to Mono, we do need to have a complete set of free documentation written specifically for Mono.

The wiki is designed to be a centralized repository for all mono-related documentation and information, to make it easy for users to find what they need.

The wiki is currently a pretty good mess, and we desperately need your help with cleaning up existing pages, as well as writing new ones.

Writing New Pages
=================

-   Think about something that you recently had a lot of trouble finding information about and create a page dedicated to it!

-   If you need an idea for something to write, check out Special:Wantedpages.

Cleanup
=======

Here are some suggestions of ways to help clean the wiki up:

-   **Go through the [documentation table of contents](/Start) and find new things to add to it.<br/>
    **
-   Go through Special:Shortpages and add more content.
-   Go through Special:Lonelypages, figure out which page(s) should link back to this page, and add the link.
-   Go through the Uncategorizedpages list and categorize the pages.
-   Go through the Longpages list and if it makes sense, split them up into seporate pages.
-   If you see a page that looks like a big mess, add "****

    ``` nowiki
    {{NeedsCleanup}}
    ```

    " to the top.<br/>
    You can see every page that is marked as needing cleanup at [NeedsCleanup](/Category:NeedsCleanup).

-   If you see a page that looks incomplete, add "****

    ``` nowiki
    {{Incomplete}}
    ```

    " to the top.<br/>
    You can see every page that is marked as incomplete at [Incomplete](/Category:Incomplete).

-   If you see a page that looks out of date, add "****

    ``` nowiki
    {{Obsolete}}
    ```

    " to the top.<br/>
    You can see every page that is marked as obsolete at [Obsolete](/Category:Obsolete).

-   Go through the mailing list archives, and pay attention on IRC. If someone asked a question that was answered, but is not properly documented, create a new wiki page or add it to the [FAQ](/FAQ).

In-Progress Tasks & Discussion
==============================

-   See the [Talk:Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project](/Talk:Mono_Documentation_Improvement_Project) page for an overview about what all is currently being discussed.
-   All articles that are currently under construction can be found in the [Sandbox-Category](/Category:Sandbox)

Writing good Documentation
==========================

[TechScribe](http://www.techscribe.co.uk/techw/articles.htm) is full of short articles about good documentation, please take a look at them.

Prizes
======

Novell will hopefully be able to offer mono schwag (stickers, t-shirts, etc.) as prizes to those who work on documentation, more information to come soon.
