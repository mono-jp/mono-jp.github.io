Roadmap History
===============

This page contains the history of the [Roadmap](/Mono_Project_Roadmap) page. It is left here for historical purposes. For our current roadmap, please see [Roadmap](/Mono_Project_Roadmap).

Notice that before Mono 2.0, every public release version that was available was a stable release (1.9, 1.9.1, 1.2.6, 1.2.6.1 and so on).

Previous Goals
--------------

### Mono 1.0 goals

The Mono 1.0 release would include the following components:

-   C# compiler.

-   VM, with JIT and pre-compiler.

-   IL assembler, disassembler.

-   Development and security tools.

-   Core libraries: mscorlib, System, System.XML.

-   System.Data and Mono database providers.

-   System.Web: Web applications platform and Apache integration module.

-   System.Web.Services: client and server support.

-   System.Drawing.

-   System.DirectoryServices

-   JIT support: x86, SPARC and PPC architectures (interpreter available for other architectures).

-   ECMA profiles: special build options to build Mono as an implementation of the various ECMA profiles will be available.

-   Java integration through IKVM.

-   Embedding interface for the runtime.

Packaging:

-   mono: will contain the above features implementing the .NET 1.1 API.

-   mono-1.0-compat: Will include a build of the libraries with the .NET 1.0 API, this is a compatibility build for people running .NET 1.0 applications.

-   mono-unstable: Will contain a snapshot of the other technologies under development for developer's convenience, but will be unsupported at this time. These include the Generics edition of the C# compiler.

-   mono-ecma: A build that only includes the ECMA components.

Released on June 30th, 2004.

Bug fix releases would be done on a monthly basis.

Roadmap Background
------------------

This document describes the high-level roadmap for [Mono](http://www.go-mono.com).

The Mono project started in 2001 as an effort to implement the .NET Framework to Unix. To bring both the new programming model based on the Common Language Infrastructure and C# as well as helping people migrate their existing knowledge and applications to Unix. Mono today supports a wide variety of operating systems, CPUs and a large chunk of the functionality available in the .NET Framework.

This document outlines the roadmap for the Mono project from my perspective: what we can effectively deliver on the dates outlined. Since Mono is a large open source project, things might change and new features can be incorporated into the plan if external sources devote enough attention to those problems.

### Background

So far Microsoft has published five versions of the .NET Framework: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5.

1.1 was an incremental update over 1.0.

2.0 was a considerable expansion on the features of it.

In addition, an "add-on" to the core of .NET has been released, called ".NET 3.0", but it does not touch the core. It is a set of new APIs and extensions that run on top of a .NET 2.0 installation.

.NET 3.5 is the actual heir to .NET 2.0, and it contains updates to the core libraries (small bits) and new assemblies (like System.Core).

The Mono project has been tracking some of the improvements available in those releases, some of the highlights of our work so far are:

-   Core: mscorlib, System and System.XML assemblies. These support both the 1.x and 2.0 profiles. Work is underway to complete the [2.0 profile](/Completing2.0Profile).

-   [ADO.NET](/ADO.NET): System.Data and various other database providers, they are 1.x complete, and most of 2.x is complete

-   [ASP.NET](/ASP.NET) 1.x and 2.x: WebForms and Web Services are supported. Only WebParts are missing from our 2.x support.

-   System.Security support 1.1 features and has partial support for 2.0 (like XML encryption) but the S.S.C.Pkcs namespace is still imcomplete.

-   DirectoryServices implemented on top of Novell.LDAP

-   [Windows.Forms](/WinForms) 1.1 with almost complete 2.0 support.

-   [System.Drawing](/Drawing) supports both 1.x and 2.0 profiles.

-   Compilers: C# 1 and 2 as well as bits of 3, VB.NET 8 and various command line tools that are part of the SDK.

-   Transaction support, we have some partial support but currently no plans exist beyond the current implementation (see the [notes](/Transactions) on its implementation and limitations).

-   Open Source, Unix and Gnome specific libraries, see our [Plans](/Plans) page for more details.

There are certain features that we are not planning on supporting and are available either as stubs (to allow other code to compile or to satisfy dependencies) or are not even present in Mono, these include:

-   EnterpriseServices
-   [Web Services Enhancements (WSE)](/WSE)
-   System.Management: too Windows specific
-   [System.Messaging](/System.Messaging).

Support for designers in Windows.Forms and ASP.NET for the majority of Mono provided controls does not exist. This is due to the lack of tools for designing Windows.Forms and ASP.NET components in Mono today. When designer surfaces are completed (there are work in progress for both of them) work on this areas will resume.

Designer support is only needed at development-time, this is not something that is required to run the applications on Unix. Many applications that are reported through the [Mono Migration Analysis](/MoMA) tool reports these problems and can be safely ignored.

Some components exist that were once developed but are no longer actively developed, these include:

-   [Transactions](/Transactions)
-   [JScript](/JScript)

See the following sections for more details on plans for 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5 APIs.

### Mono release strategy

The levels of maturity of Mono fluctuate depending on the development effort we have put into it, and the use we have given to them. For example, the virtual machine and the C# compiler very mature, while less commonly used functionality in Mono like Windows.Forms or VB.NET are still under heavy development.

Our strategy is to release the mature components as Mono 1.0, and have upcoming versions of Mono add extra functionality.

### Microsoft's .NET 2.0

To understand post 1.0 editions of Mono, it is important to put it into perspective .NET 2.0 which was released in November 2005.

The new features in .NET 2.0 include:

-   **Generic types** These introduce changes to the compiler, runtime and class libraries.

-   **C# 2.0** Many new additions to the language.

-   **ASP.NET 2** Many tools to simplify web application development: Master pages, new controls for common operations, personalization and themes.

-   **Remoting** New security channels and version-resistant remoting (good news in the interop department).

-   **XML** Relatively small changes and improvements which Mono has currently. Mono in addition will ship an XQuery processor.

-   **Networking** FTP client, Ssl streams.

-   **Console and Serial ports:**\</br\> Console terminal input/output is available as well as serial port handling.

-   **Windows.Forms** Layout containers finally appeared on Windows.Forms as well as various new controls.
