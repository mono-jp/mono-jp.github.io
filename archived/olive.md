Olive
=====

Olive is a set of add-on libraries for the Mono core that bring some of the new .NET APIs to Mono.

Olive is unsupported, should be considered as experimental software, and since it implements a shifting API there are no guarantees of any kind about the stability of the API.

Currently Olive contains:

-   [Workflow](/Workflow) 3.5 APIs
-   PresentationFoundation and WindowsBase (only XAML support)

If you are interested in contributing see our [contributing guidelines](/Contributing). You can also get a fresh copy from our anonymous SVN repository.
