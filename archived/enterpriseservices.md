EnterpriseServices
==================

At this point Mono does not support the EnterpriseServices namespace.

Microsoft is phasing out EnterpriseServices in favor of Indigo, at this point an unreleased piece of software.

Some consideration has been given to create a shared substrate that could be used by both an open source EnterpriseServices and an Indigo implementation, but little or no code has been produced.

Some related components being developed and designed include:

-   [Transactions processing](/Transactions)
-   [Messaging support](/System.Messaging)
