Talk:New Version of the Use-Page
================================

To sum up what I'm trying to do here I'll just copy a passage from one of my mails to the list:

Recently I was thinking about of rewriting the Use-Page. At the moment it is just a list of tools that can be used but I'm thinking of rewriting it in a way that does not show what of mono can be used but in what way mono can be used.

For example: Use case 1: Develop Cross Plattform Apps. Use case 2: Develop Web Apps. Use case 3: Port an App from Windows to Linux. Use case 4: Embedd Mono into your App. Use case 5: Something completely different.

Each of those use cases should contain a link to a page which summarizes the use case and gives hints and shortcuts how to achieve the goal. (Okay the last one should point to a place where for example research projects based on mono can publish what they've done so far and how they have achieved it...)

Preconditions of using something?
---------------------------------

While writing the article the thought crossed my mind that it might be useful to cover the preconditions of using Mono in this article as well. But of course just in a few sentences.

Therefore the Support and Getting Mono Paragraph. Or is this unnecessary? Any Comments?

I think the Getting Mono part is fine. The Support part is probably not needed. I really like the idea of breaking this down by use case. In my notes, I had broken it down into the same categories as your first three. However, I hadn't really gotten much further than that. I think Embedding may be obscure enough to go under Other, but that's just my opinion.

My recommendation would be to keep everything on this page as brief as possible, mainly each section should be a list of links to other pages with the real content. The idea being to allow people to quickly scan to their use case, and see a list of resources that will help get them started.

I've written the support part with the thought in mind that safety always comes first. In this case: before someone starts using mono he should be aware where to get help in case something doesn't work as expected. But if the majority thinks it not necessary it can be of course removed.

As for the rest of the page: I'm done so far and now waiting for reviews.
