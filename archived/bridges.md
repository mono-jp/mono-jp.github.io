ObjC#
-----

[ObjC#](/ObjCSharp) is a transparent two way bridge that allows the CLR to access the rich underlying ObjectiveC frameworks as well as providing direct access to the CLR frameworks from the ObjectiveC language.

IKVM
----

[IKVM](/IKVM) is a framework required to host and interface with Java byte code on top of the MS .NET and Mono runtimes.

GAPI
----

[GAPI](/GAPI) is a xml based code generator included in GTK#, to build bindings (ussally) completely 100% cli based bridges to many different GObject and GLib classes.

SWIG
----

Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) is a code generator that builds bindings for many languages including C# to communicate with C and C++. (It should be noted that most nearly all C interfaces can be handled by the built-in p/invoke interfaces without the need to use SWIG to do this)
