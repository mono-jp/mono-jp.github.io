Overview
========

Boo is a new object oriented statically typed programming language for the Common Language Infrastructure with a python inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Features such as type inference, closures (similar to C#'s anonymous delegates), duck typing, and syntactic macros are just a few of the features Boo offers that are not found in many currently available CLI languages.

Syntax Example
==============

    namespace BooSyntaxExample

    class NamedClass:
        private name as string

        def constructor (name as string):
            self.name = name

        def ToString():
            return name

    named = NamedClass ('Say my name!')

    print named
