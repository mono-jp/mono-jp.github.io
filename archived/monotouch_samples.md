MonoTouch Samples
=================

We have ported some sample applications from CocoaTouch/Objective-C to [MonoTouch](/MonoTouch), you can:

-   [Browse the Source Code on the web](http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/monotouch/samples/)
-   Use [AnonSVN](/SourceCodeRepository) to download a copy to your machine using SVN.
-   [Download a tarball.](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monotouch-samples-2009-09-11.tar.gz)

Most of the samples are built using the pure SDK and Unix makefiles. This is done to illustrate the process used.

There is one MonoDevelop for iPhone setup called `monocatalog-md` which is identical to `monocatalog`. The only difference is that this is a pre-made MonoDevelop solution file.

The samples require [MonoTouch to be installed](/MonoTouch_Installation).
