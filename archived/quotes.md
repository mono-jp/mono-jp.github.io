A few quotes from developers using Mono:

[Dalton Caldwell, Imeem CEO](http://dalton.imeem.com/blogentry/fEEiPiEw):

    I had used C# before, which I really liked, but disliked the Microsoft-only
    aspects of it.  However, I had been watching the Mono project since it was
    announced.  There were few people in the Open Source world that held more
    credibility in my eyes than Miguel de Icaza. When I first looked at mono in
    2003, I was impressed with the quality of the product, even at that early
    stage.

    So, when we started imeem, we cross-compiled it on mono from day 1.  We didn't
    "port" to mono, mono was just part of our toolkit from the get-go.  It works
    really well.  Ximian/Novell has responded to bug-reports in a timely and
    helpful manner.  I have been able to meet a lot of the Mono team in real life,
    and they are genuinely funny, nice people.

    So anyway, thanks to the Mono project.  I hope we can work together as imeem
    grows.

[Joe Ante](http://galactus.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2005-May/027196.html) from [Otee](http://www.otee.dk), the makers of Unity:

    My company is using mono in a 3d game engine and wysiwyg game design tool.
    We have embedded mono and use it as a scripting language. This allows our
    users to pick from Javascript, C# and Boo.

    Being able to use multiple languages is just wonderful and adds a lot of
    value to our product. The speed of mono is absolutely stunning. (We are
    coming from python). Switching from python to mono was an absolute success.

[Quantify Solutions](http://galactus.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2005-May/027131.html):

    My company uses Mono to run our software on Linux/Solaris servers.  We provide
    advanced analytics for pricing and risk management of credit derivatives.  The
    analytics toolkit is composed of a mixture of C# and C++ (we chose .NET as our
    platform in part because of its excellent support for interop with unmanaged
    code).

    In addition to the Toolkit, we also provide a Calculation Server (written in
    C#) and an Excel Addin (written in C# with a bit of Managed C++).  Of course
    the Excel Addin is MS specific.

    Our support for Mono is relatively new and still considered beta, however
    we run our full regression test suite on Mono/Linux, so I think this can be
    considered a "real world" application.

[Jon Walker](http://galactus.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2005-May/027110.html) CTO from Versora:

    My company (http://www.versora.com) uses Mono in a real world
    application. We do software that migrates system settings, application
    settings and data from Windows to Linux. We chose it because we had a
    large code base in C# .NET on Windows and a large portion of that code
    was reusable with minimal effort on Linux/Mono.

 [Bill Seddon, reporting a problem on Mono](http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2006-January/030276.html):

    My reason is that Mono applications can be run without an install.  .NET
    requires a lengthy installation (and a reboot with 1.1 SP) that many
    administrators (if not users) will not consider.  Mono can be copied on (or
    even run from a memory stick).

From a satisfied user on our [mailing list](http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2005-April/026486.html):

    Ive recently successfully ported an ASP.Net application from MS .net to
    mono-1.1.4.

    This application was approximately 250-300 days development, is
    currently deployed and in production on windows server 2003, has 2
    external interfaces and used an MS SQL server database.

    As an experiment I ported it to mono and mysql in approximately 20
    hours, and had it running under apache on an ubuntu linux box.
