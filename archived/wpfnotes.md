Storyboard and Animations
=========================

Storylines can contain multiple animations, which use the timer infrastructure in the main loop to raise the events.

There is no separate thread to raise the events, it is possible to create an object that hangs for a few seconds when setting the value of a property:

``` csharp
PhotosProperty = DependencyPRoperty.Register ("Photos", typeof (int), typeof(Camera),
         new PropertyMetadata (32, changed_callback);
..
 
static void changed_callback (DependencyObject target,
                              DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
{
        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep (10000);
}
```

And to try this animation use:

``` csharp
class Window ... {
Camera c = new Camera ();
NameScope.SetNamespace (this, new NameScope ());
RegisterName ("camera", c);
Int32Animation anum = new Int32Animation (0, 10, new Duration (new TimeSpan (0, 0, 40));
Storyboard s = new Storyboard ();
s.Children.Add (anim);
 
// This is funky, you set these two properties through Storyboard,
// for the actual animation, not through the animation itself.
Storyboard.SetTargetName (anim, "camera");
Storyboard.SetTargetProperty (anim, new PropertyPath (Camera.PhotosProperty));
 
s.Begin (this);
```

Interception of Properties
==========================

Unlike .NET properties, where interception happens in the setter (to perform book-keeping) WPF has a runtime system for this purpose. The idea apparently was to build "lighter" objects by turning properties that would be seldom set into runtime settable properties that are kept on a dictionary.

To intercept value setting of those properties, the PropertyMetadata is used when creating the property in the call to DependencyProperty.Register, here some callbacks for get, set, invalidate and maybe a few others are provided, as well as the default value for the property.

Simplified Class Hierarchy
==========================

The following is a simplified class hierarchy for the rendering system that might help understand how things work. The words in parenthesis are the important properties introduced in a given class.

Paths
-----

Relationship of the various Path classes:

-   Paths contain Geometries
    -   GeometryGroup (a kind of Geometry) composes various existing geometries.
    -   PathGeometry (a kind of Geometry) contain PathFigureCollections
        -   PathFigureCollections are collections that contain PathFigures
            -   PathFigures are made up of PathSegments
