Creating a UI with Interface Builder
====================================

User interfaces created with Interface Builder are stored in XML in files ending with the XIB extension. These XIB files contain a definition of your user interface.

In Interface Builder in addition to laying out your user interface, you can flag certain components to be accessible from your C# code and you can configure which events will be raised against your host while responding to some events.

Loading Interfaces
==================

If you are using MonoDevelop, the XIB will automatically be compiled into a binary representation with the "nib" extension. If you are building the user interface on your own you will have to compile the user interface using the `ibtool` command. For example:

``` bash
ibtool SampleController.xib --compile SampleController.nib
```

The XIB files can contain:

-   ViewController definitions
-   ...

To load a component from a view controller stored in the NIB file, declare your class in the following way:

``` csharp
[Register]
public class SampleController : UIViewController {
    public SampleController () : base ("SampleController", null)
    {
    }
}
```

The above shows how the class SampleController is initialized by calling the base class constructor that initializes the class from the NIB file. In this case the NIB file is the "SampleController" specified as the first parameter to the base call, and the second argument is the NSBundle to load this from. Null represent the current bundle.

When the view is loaded the method `ViewDidLoad` will be invoked. This is the method where you would typically customize the controls and views loaded from the NIB file and perhaps add new controls to your view, for example:

``` csharp
public override ViewDidLoad ()
{
   // Let the base class do its initialization.
   base.ViewDidLoad ();
Â 
   // Add a web control and configure it
    web = new UIWebView (webFrame) {
        BackgroundColor = UIColor.White,
        ScalesPageToFit = true,
        AutoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleHeight
    };
    web.LoadStarted += delegate {
        UIApplication.SharedApplication.NetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = true;
    };
    web.LoadFinished += delegate {
        UIApplication.SharedApplication.NetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = false;
    };
    web.LoadError += (webview, args) => {
        UIApplication.SharedApplication.NetworkActivityIndicatorVisible = false;
        web.LoadHtmlString (HtmlErroString, null);
    };
    View.AddSubview (web);
}
```

Naming Your Components
======================

Responding to Events
====================

If your user interface raises an event on the "First Responder", you can catch those events by decorating your C# method with the Export attribute, like this:

``` csharp
[Export ("SomeEvent:")]
public void SomeEvent (NSObject sender)
{
}
```

Important
=========

If you are going to load your application delegate from a NIB file created by Interface Builder instead of rolling out the application delegate yourself, you will want to make sure that you invoke UIApplication.Main with null parameters for the application class and delegate class.

Otherwise UIApplication will create the delegate twice: one from the NIB request, and one from the UIApplication parameter.

What happens behind the scenes
