Linux Binary Installation
-------------------------

On Linux, Mono is available in various forms: through the [Red Carpet](ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/ximian/redcarpet2) installation software, as installers, or as packages that you can install. To learn which way is best for you, consult our [Getting Mono](/Obtaining_Mono) page.

Linux IDEs for Mono
===================

As you might expect, there are many development tools available to C# developers, ranging from bare-bones text editors to complex integrated development environments.

MonoDevelop
-----------

[MonoDevelop](http://monodevelop.com) is a project to create an IDE for .NET programming written in C#, using the Gtk# platform. It is actively under development, and is useable, though a bit unstable.

Basic Text Editors
------------------

[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) are general purpose text editors, not IDEs designed for use with .NET and C#. However, you can use them to write software in nearly any language. For Emacs, you will want to use the C# major mode available at [davh.dk](http://davh.dk/script/) or [www.cybercom.net](http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs/) to handle syntax coloring and proper indentation. Vim supports syntax highlighting for C#, but not much else.

Other recommended text editors include: [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org/).

Eclipse in C# Mode
-------------------

The [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) project is better known for its Java IDE, and is in fact written in Java. However, it is a full-featured development environment which can be used with plugins for many other languages, including C#.

To use Eclipse with Mono, you will need to install a Java Runtime Environment from [IBM](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux130/?dwzone=java) or [Sun](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-linux.html), and you will also need one of the following plugins for editing with C#:

-   [C# Plugin from BlackSun](http://black-sun.sourceforge.net/).
-   [Emonic Plugin](http://emonic.sourceforge.net/).
-   [C# Plugin from Improve Technologies.](http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/)

Once all three pieces are installed, consult the Eclipse C# plugin documentation for instructions on how to proceed.
