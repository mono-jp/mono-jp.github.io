NUnit
=====

What Is NUnit?
--------------

NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all languages running on Mono or .NET.

Initially ported from JUnit, it was modified to take advantage of custom attributes, which are used to mark test classes and methods. It is now in its fifth major release. NUnit is written entirely in C# and runs on all platforms that support Mono.

What About NUnitLite?
---------------------

NUnitLite is what it says: a lightweight version of NUnit. It is suitable for testing on devices that use the compact framework or a device-specific Mono installation. It is also useful for other non-device applications that require embedding the test framework right in the code - in a web server or plugin for example.
