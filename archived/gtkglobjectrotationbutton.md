GtkGL.ObjectRotationButton
==========================

Perhaps I should re-name this GtkGL.GLObjectRotationButton to match the convention used in [GtkGL.IGLObject](/GtkGL.IGLObject) and [GtkGL.GLObjectBase](/GtkGL.GLObjectBase).

This class is derived from Gtk.Button. It takes as its constructor's arguments the GL object it will be acting upon, and the rotation that the button will apply to the object.
