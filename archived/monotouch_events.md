MonoTouch Events
================

If you want to intercept events from UIControl, you have a range of options: from using the C# lambdas and delegate functions to using the low-level Objective-C APIs.

The following shows how you would capture the TouchDown event on a button, depending on how much control you need:

C# Style
=========

Using the delegate syntax:

``` csharp
UIButton button = MakeTheButton ();
button.TouchDown += delegate {
    Console.WriteLine ("Touched");
};
```

If you like lambdas instead:

``` csharp
button.TouchTown += () => {
   Console.WriteLine ("Touched");
};
```

If you want to have multiple buttons use the same handler to share the same code:

``` csharp
void handler (object sender, EventArgs args)
{
   if (sender == button1)
      Console.WriteLine ("button1");
   else
      Console.WriteLine ("some other button");
}
 
button1.TouchDown += handler;
button2.TouchDown += handler;
```

Monitoring more than one kind of Event
======================================

The C# events for UIControlEvent flags have a one to one mapping to individual flags. Sometimes you might want to have the same piece of code handle two or more events, in that case, use the UIControl.AddTarget method:

``` csharp
button.AddTarget (handler, UIControlEvent.TouchDown | UIControl.TouchCancel);
```

Using the lambda syntax:

``` csharp
button.AddTarget (()=> Console.WriteLine ("An event happened"), UIControlEvent.TouchDown | UIControl.TouchCancel);
```

If you need to use low-level features of Objective-C, like hooking up to a particular object instance and invoke a particular selector:

``` csharp
[Export ("MySelector")]
void MyObjectiveCHandler ()
{
    Console.WriteLine ("Hello!");
}
 
// In some other place:
 
button.AddTarget (this, new Selector ("MySelector"), UIControlEvent.TouchDown);
```
