Talk:Need Help
==============

[Adrien Dessemond](mailto:adrien.dessemond@softhome.net) mentioned on the docs-list that this could be expanded by first-aid support for ASP.NET related stuff. In general a good idea, however since I've got no experience with this someone else should probably look into it and adapt the article.
