OldStart
========

 Mono is an open-source project providing the necessary software to develop and run .NET client and server applications on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, Windows, and Unix.

If you are new to Unix, you can start by downloading our [VMware Image](/VMware_Image) from our [Downloads](/Downloads) page, as it contains everything you need to get started to use Mono to move your Windows applications to Linux.

You can use our [Mono Migration Assistant](/MoMA) tool on Windows to identify the porting issues before you start.

Mono in Action
==============

Mono 1.0 was released over two years ago, in June 2004, and since then Mono has been taken up as the platform of choice for many open-source and commercial projects. See Mono in action:

-   [Screenshots](/Screenshots)
-   [Videos](/Videos)
-   [Applications](/Software) that use Mono (Commercial and open source)

The .NET platform is unique in many ways, one being its ability to host many languages. Another is the ability to [bridge](/Bridges) between other runtimes. [C#](/CSharp_Compiler), [Boo](/Boo), and [Java](/Java) are just some of the [languages](/Languages) supported by Mono.

For more technical details, see the description of the [Runtime](/Mono:Runtime).

Implementation Status
=====================

Much of the original .NET 1.1 specification has been implemented in Mono. Most work today is going into implementing the changes in .NET 2.0. Here is the status of some of the core technologies:
