<p>As of this version, Mono 1.1.4 has received more testing and more scrutiny that Mono 1.0.6, and we strongly recommend that people switch to the 1.1.4 release.</p>
<p>We will continue to support 1.0.x for those who can not do a larger change, but keep in mind that 1.1.4 at this point is stabler, has many less bugs, faster, better tested and more complete than the 1.0.6 series.</p>
<p>There are significant changes: make sure you read the release notes as there are many exiting features in monodoc, xsp, apache support, xml, relaxng, the C# compiler, the VM and more.</p>
<p>Detailed release notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.6/">Release notes</a> for Mono 1.0.6, xsp, mod_mono, monodoc</li>
