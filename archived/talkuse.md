Talk:Use
========

Hi all, I'm new here and don't want to shake the boat too much.

After browsing these pages it's very clear that there are a ton of helpful resources but it's not at all obvious how to find them. The documenation section, presumably this Use section, is very confusing. There are a ton of unreferenced articles that are very helpful, but are simply categorized under GtkSharp. The best example is the treeview which wasn't even categorized so you had to do a search for it to even find it (I just categorized it). It seems to me that it should be very simple for the user to find these types of things as examples are easily the most helpful. Maybe it should start out with a topics sections. Like Gtk, the user clicks Gtk and is presented with an overview section, then an example senction, and finally a link to the monodoc section for a full API reference.

My point here is that currently it's not easy to find answers. I think a basic rethinking of the documentation needs to happen. I don't understand the monkey guide concept at all as it's not obvious why clicking on that link will help a user. My proposal is to make everything topical. If something in the monkey guide covers gtk then it should be moved under the gtk topical section. This won't be easy, certain examples may show how to program an entire small application that consists of GTK#, C#, etc. This would require a lot of cross referencing (a topic would probably need to be had for example programs, if it's a gtk based program it should be referenced in the Gtk section, etc).

To me it's all about finding answers and as I've associated with a lot of other new mono programmers it's clear that it's not easy to find the wealth of information available on this site.

Last thought, the main main manuals & docs link on the main toolbar should go into a documention section, as described, not just the API reference provided by monodoc.

New Version of this page
------------------------

After a little discussion on the mono-docs-list to check if this little project is wanted I'm now trying to write a new version of this page under [New Version of the Use-Page](/New_Version_of_the_Use-Page). Please check it once in a while to give me some feedback (or contributions). For discussion about whether it makes sense to rewrite this page please answer to this Talk-Page or the docs list. If you have comments about my new Version of the page please write them down [here](/Talk:New_Version_of_the_Use-Page). Thanks
