Working with Mono and Visual Studio
===================================

 Tools and Tips for Building & Testing Visual Studio.NET Projects with Mono.

**Warning: VSPrj2Make# is unmaintained and only supports VS2003 style solutions. If you wish to generate makefiles from VS2005 or VS2008 solutions, you should use the generation capability provided in MonoDevelop.**

Once you have Mono installed in your system, you will want to install the VSPrj2Make# package to complement your Visual Studio environment. VSPrj2Make is available from [its project page](http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfcontent/downloads.php/prj2make-sharp/Windows/).

A screencast on how to install it is available [here](http://www.mfconsulting.com/product/prj2make-sharp/tutorial/installing-vsprj2make.html).

VSPrj2Make provides an add-in to Visual Studio that offers a number of features:

-   Create Makefiles (both Microsoft's NMake and Unix Make).
-   Create distribution units (packages your source code for building elsewhere).
-   Test your code from Visual Studio with Mono (Winforms, Gtk# and WebForms and WebServices).

This is available from the tools menu in Visual Studio:
