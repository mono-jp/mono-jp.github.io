User:ValentinSawadski
=====================

Hi, I'm Valentin a young male Mono developer from germany. I haven't had the chance to contribute very much to the Mono-Project so far, in fact apart from some very minor changes to the wiki and some short mails in the mailing lists I've done nothing.

However I want to help and contribute by mostly giving support on the lists and improving the documentation and this wiki. Therefore this page will give an overview of what I'm currently working on.

Kind Regards, Valentin.

**Articles I'm working on:**

-   **[New Version of the Use-Page](/New_Version_of_the_Use-Page)**: The Entry-Usage article is currently all about "Use this or that of Mono", while I'm trying to rewrite the article in a way that shows *what* Mono can be used for.
