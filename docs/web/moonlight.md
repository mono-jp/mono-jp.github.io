Moonlight is an open source implementation of [Silverlight](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/silverlight/bb187358.aspx), primarily for Linux and other Unix/X11 based operating systems. The last Moonlight release (Moonlight 4 Preview 1) provides support for most features of Silverlight 3, as well as compatibility with Silverlight 4. The Mono project does not provide binary downloads for Moonlight; however, packages for most Linux distributions can be found online, either in official distro package repositories, or provided by popular third-party repositories.

**Note: Moonlight isn't actively developed anymore. If you're feeling adventurous you can probably get it working by compiling from [source](https://github.com/mono/moon), but we recommend you move away from Moonlight as soon as possible.**
