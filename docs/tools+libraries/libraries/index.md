[Windows.Forms](/docs/gui/winforms/)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[![Colordialog.png](/archived/images/e/ec/Colordialog.png)](/archived/images/e/ec/Colordialog.png)

[MWF](/docs/gui/winforms/)'s color dialog box

Wiki: [WinForms](/docs/gui/winforms/)

This is part of the standard Mono distribution.

This is a work-in-progress effort to implement the Microsoft System.Windows.Forms API. The API is not complete enough for many tasks, so developers (in particular third-party developers that provide custom controls) resort to use the underlying Win32 subsystem on Windows to provide features which are not exposed by Windows.Forms.

In some cases it is necessary to provide support for the Wndproc method and the various messages associated with it, and support extra functionality available in Win32 through P/Invoke, as well as exposing and sharing various kinds of handles (fonts, drawing contexts, drawing surfaces, windows).

Up until recently, this was achived using a Windows emulation layer using Wine. This method was horrible to maintain as well as having many other issues. The new implimentation included in Mono is what we referer to as the new Managed.Windows.Forms. This is a fully managed version of the System.Windows.Forms toolkit provided under the Microsoft's .NET framework. This means that everything is handled in a managed layer, from drawing the buttons and controls, to interfacing with font libraries on the system. This means it should be nearly as portable as mono itself.

There are two levels of conformance in this API: The full Windows.Forms from the .NET Framework 1.0 and 1.1, and the subset exposed by the Compact Framework.

Pros:

-   Extensive documentation exists for it (books, tutorials, online documents).

Cons:

-   Bad layout mechanisms: font size changes, and internationalization require manual relayout most of the time.
-   All the Windows.Forms efforts are under heavy development.

Xamarin.Mac

ASP.NET Components
==================

JayRock
-------

[JayRock](http://jayrock.berlios.de/) is a modest and an open source (LGPL) implementation of JSON and JSON-RPC for the Microsoft .NET Framework, including ASP.NET. What can you do with Jayrock?

==============

Emerge Toolkit
--------------

[Emerge Toolkit](http://www.emergetk.com/emergetk), The emerge toolkit is a web application development framework. The server is written in C#, and runs on .NET and Mono.

From their site:

Our goal is to reduce the clutter when developing AJAX-style web applications. The experience of writing an emergetk application feels like writing a desktop application, with state preservation, widgets, events and handlers, and so forth. It accomplishes what ASP.NET does, but without using any viewstate.

We support - without enforcing - MVC style development. Since this is a well understood pattern, we will address each of the three components below.

MonoRail
--------

[MonoRail](http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/MonoRail) (former Castle on Rails) is a MVC web framework inspired by Action Pack.

MonoRail differs from the standard WebForms way of development as it enforces separation of concerns; controllers just handle application flow, models represent the data, and the view is just concerned about presentation logic. Consequently, you write less code and end up with a more maintainable application.

Deveel Ajax
-----------

[Deveel Ajax](http://deveel-ajax.svn.sourceforge.net): Another great library from Antonello Provenzano, the aim of this project was to increase development speed of .NET/Mono web applications by replicating, through a JavaScript proxies, the OO structure of imported types, based on prototype ([http://www.prototypejs.org](http://www.prototypejs.org)) AJAX framework.

Parallel Computing
==================

MPAPI
-----

[Message Passing API (MPAPI)](http://www.codeplex.com/MPAPI) is a framework that enables programmers to easily write parallel as well as distributed software systems without having to use standard thread synchronization techniques like locks, monitors, semaphors, mutexes and volatile memory.

It is written in C# and runs on Microsoft .NET 2.0 or newer, as well as Mono.NET 1.2.6.

-   Easy parallel programming through the use of message passing concurrency instead of the traditional shared state concurrency.
-   A few simple primitives to handle communication between - and control with - different threads.
-   Cluster computing made simple through the same primitives regardless of whether a thread runs locally or on a different machine. The framework simplifies the connection of computing nodes.
-   Cross-platform - the framework has been tested in a mixed environment with machines running Microsoft .NET 2.0, 3.0 and Mono.NET 1.2.6. The RemotingLite framework was written specifically to fascilitate the MPAPI frameworks need for service calls across networks, and was also specifically designed and written to run on Mono.NET.

A [paper describing MPAPI](http://sector0.dk/public_files/Introduction%20to%20Message%20Passing%20and%20the%20MPAPI%20Framework.pdf) goes into more details about it.

Database Abstraction
====================

NetDataObjects
--------------

[Net Data Objects](http://www.netdataobjects.de) is a development tool for Mono and .NET, which maps object oriented code to relational databases. This concept is called O/R Mapping (Object Relational Mapping).

NDO is able to automatically enhance the code, written and compiled with .NET and Mono The enhancement works completely transparent for the developer.

-   Developers save a lot of error prone code for data access.
-   Persistent classes in NDO work together with the NDO framework without writing any special code in the classes.
-   Object data is stored and retrieved automatically into and out of the database.
-   NDO generates new and can integrate existing databases.
-   The NDO Query Language is much easier to use than SQL and provides nearly the same abilities.
-   NDO Queries are checked by the C#- or Visual Basic compiler, while spelling mistakes in SQL queries might cause program interrupts.
-   Developers benefit from the object oriented analysis, design, and coding methodologies.
-   Thus your systems show a better maintainability and extensibility.
-   With NDO switching to another database is easy. Develop an application with SQL Server\* today and use it with Oracle\* tomorrow.

You can read about how they ported NDO to work on Mono on their ["NDO runs under Mono"](http://www.netdataobjects.com/Portal/NDORunsUnderMono/tabid/94/Default.aspx) article.

DB4O
----

[DB4O](/archived/db4o) is a non-intrusive persistence system that stores any complex object with one single line of code. The class schema of your application classes is analysed and adjusted in real time when objects are stored. Object-oriented querying functionality is provided through Native Queries (NQ), the ability to query the database using .NET syntax and semantics (similar in concept to LINQ/DLINQ), Query by Example (QbE) and other APIs. High performance is achieved with indexed fields and by reducing database-file-internal redirections to the absolute minimum. db4o features ACID transactions, fast embedded single-user mode and multi-transactional Client/Server access, locally and through TCP, object-oriented replication, and the ObjectManager to browse database files.

For more information see the Mono's [DB4O](/archived/db4o) page.
