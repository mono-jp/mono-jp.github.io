The [Mono benchmark suite](http://open.xamarin.com/benchmarker/front-end/) is a set of benchmarks that is run by CI against newly built revisions. The data thereby gathered is then put into visual form, so as to be quickly comprehensible.

The source of the benchmark suite and frontend is [available](https://github.com/xamarin/benchmarker).
