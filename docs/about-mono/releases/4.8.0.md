### API additions for .NET Standard 2.0

We added APIs to comply with .NET Standard 2.0, which is still a work in progress at the time of this writing.
Note that in some cases an implementation is still missing and will throw at runtime.

Please check the [.NET Standard repository](https://github.com/dotnet/standard) on GitHub for more details about .NET Standard.
