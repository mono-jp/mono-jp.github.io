Mono 4.4.1 is a service release for the Mono 4.4 series.

Bug Fixes
=========

* [#41775](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41775) - Zip version needed to extract not correct in System.IO.Compression
* [#41782](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41782) - [Cycle 7] &quot;System.Net.WebException: Error: NameResolutionFailure&quot; when attempting web requests with certain raw IP addresses
* [#41874](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41874) - Reflection throws AmbiguousMatchException when calling GetProperty on a class that inherits from a generic base class.

Changes in the OSX installation package
=======================================

The Mono package now uses a file in `/etc/paths.d` for adding the Mono commands to the PATH on OSX, instead of adding symlinks to `/usr/local/bin` which is in the PATH by default. A side effect of this is that the Mono commands won't be available in your terminal session right away until you restart it.

If you install Mono in a script or some other automated manner you can run `eval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)` to reload the PATH changes and make the commands available. We're looking at integrating this into the installer in a future release.
