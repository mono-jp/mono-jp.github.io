title: New in Mono 3.1.1
version: 3.1.1
releasedate: '2013-07-17'
---

What's new
----------

Mono now defaults to sgen

Fixed AOT on OSX 10.9

Update Mono.Cairo to include APIs from cairo 1.10

Update the LLVM used from Nov-2012 to Jul-2013

Several optimizations to improve string performance, exposed by a naive implementation of Sudoku:

-   Enable managed allocation using gsharing
-   Implemented the string allocator for SGen
-   Fixed String.Contains, as it is not supposed to be culture aware (Mono was, so we took a big perf hit, and were wrong)

Added a dummy implementation of System.Net.Http.WebRequestHandler

On iOS, managed-to-native wrappers now follow the native ABI and can be unwinded.

Better FreeBSD support, sgen and dtrace can now be enabled
