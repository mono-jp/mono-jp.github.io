Changes since the Mono 1.0.1 release
------------------------------------

The following is a description of the changes and bug fixes since the Mono 1.0.1 release. For changes from 1.0 to 1.0.1 see [Mono 1.0.1 release notes](http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.1/).

This release continues to improve the reliability of XSP and ASP.NET as a result of using this on the main Mono web site.

Some small performance improvements have been back ported from the development release of Mono, but this is mostly purely a bug fix and stability release.
