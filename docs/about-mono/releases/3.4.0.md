Mono 3.4.0 is a culmination of 825 commits since the last release. This is the work of 55 contributors since Mid-January 2014 and includes a number of feature, stability, and performance improvements. 92 bugs were fixed in this release.

Revamped HttpWebRequest/ServicePoint stack
------------------------------------------

-   Should properly reuse connections.
-   Uses the specified Idle times.
-   NTLM support has been improved.
-   SSL/TLS operations on via async APIs are now implemented using async patterns internally to greatly alleviate Thread Pool abuse.

Network stack
-------------

-   Now allows developers to control which cipher suites to use with TLS/SSL.

ARM
---

-   Emit shorter floating point operations when possible
-   Hard float support: Mono now should work on Linux distributions which uses a hard float (`armhf`) ABI, like the Raspberry PI.

Notes: Homogeneous floating point aggregates are not yet supported on armhf.

Documentation
-------------

-   Updated documentation stubs to the 4.5 .NET API.

mono-api-html
-------------

-   Now supports regular expressions when specifying members to ignore (e.g. `mono-api-html -i 'INSCopying$'`).

Breaking changes
----------------

-   `mkbundle` on Mac OS X now must always link against the Objective-C Runtime (`-lobjc`, however, it is recommended to link against the Foundation framework as well (`-framework Foundation`).
