title: Release Notes Mono 2.10.2
version: 2.10.2
releasedate: '2011-04-25'
---

Mono is a portable and open source implementation of the .NET framework for Unix, Windows, MacOS and other operating systems.

Mono 2.10.2 is a minor update to [Mono 2.10](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.0/) based on the mono-2-10 branch of github. Mono 2.10.2 was released on April 25, 2011.

Important Information About Mono 2.10
=====================================

Mono's Long Term Supported release continues to be Mono 2.6, the next long-term support release will be Mono 3.0.

Mono 2.10 ships the latest and greatest and updates and they have not received as much testing as they should. Users seeking absolute stability should stay on Mono 2.6. Users switching to Mono 2.10, should expect a faster bug turn around time, but they should also plan on upgrading to the upcoming 2.10.xx series as we fix bugs in our stack.

Major Highlights
================

This release can run Microsoft's OrchardCMS, an open source CMS system built using the best .NET practices, and uses the delightful Razor engine.

We added support for PostgreSQL to Orchard and [submitted our patches to the OrchardCMS community](http://orchard.codeplex.com/discussions/247340).

Both Mac packages are now self-contained. If you previously downloaded the Framework and the C SDK you can now install just the SDK (MDK) package.
