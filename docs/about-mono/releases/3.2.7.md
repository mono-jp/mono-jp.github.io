title: New in Mono 3.2.7
version: 3.2.7
releasedate: '2014-02-24'
---

This is a major feature release that accumulates about 5 months of development

Highlights
----------

5 months of work, 1235 commits by 65 contributors.

Initial support for the hardfp ABI on ARM. This enables mono to be used on more recent versions of linux and produce better code on those targets.

The ABCREM optimization received a lot of love, now it works much better on 64bits systems.

Two new optimizations were added, a Loop Invariant Code Motion pass and Alias Analysis are now available. Performance in some functions can improve as much as 20%.

Hardware fences and atomic operations got a large revamp together with support for dynamic feature detection.

64bits CAS instructions are now supported on 32bits systems. This resulted in a significant performance boost on PLINQ workloads with multiple core.

Our LLVM integration got some love. It can now generate fast TLS access, a more recent LLVM version is been used and the list of optimizations we let it perform has been updated.

Our GC received some micro-optimization love by some small optimization in internal data structures and the use of intrinsics to speed up some core loops.

System.Core now has an interpreter for LINQ expressions and dynamic statements that can be used by FullAOT runtimes.

Better support for custom task schedulers.

Significantly improved reachability and flow analysis in C# compiler.
