Changes
=======

-   Fix a libgdiplus issue that had forced linking against Apple's X11 stack for text rendering.
-   Fix issue where a native crash causes MonoDevelop to hang and neither Force Quit nor kill -9 would terminate it (Xamarin #2548).
-   Fix sgen failing with Assertion at sgen-gc.c:2506, condition \`mono_sgen_need_bridge_processing ()' not met.

See the [Mono 2.10.7 release notes](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.10.7/) for a full list of Mono changes since the last stable release.
