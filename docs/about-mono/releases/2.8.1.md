Important Information About Mono 2.8.1
======================================

Mono 2.8.1 is a bug fix release for [Mono 2.8](/docs/about-mono/releases/2.8.1) that contains the major fixes for bugs that were identified in Mono 2.8, it also contains a few security fixes.

Mono's Long Term Supported release continues to be Mono 2.6, the next long-term support release will be Mono 3.0. Mono 2.8 ships the latest and greatest and updates and they have not received as much testing as they should. Users seeking absolute stability should stay on Mono 2.6. Users switching to Mono 2.8, should expect a faster bug turn around time, but they should also plan on upgrading to the upcoming 2.xx series as we fix bugs in our stack.
