S390x Status
------------

The s390x port of Mono on Linux was contributed by Neale Ferguson and is currently maintained by him and Sine Nomine Associates. Mono on s390x supports Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation. The JIT produces code for the z10 and upwards. The runtime is able to determine the facilities available on the processor and produce code optimized for the platform.

s390x Specific Optimizations
============================

-   Thread local storage (TLS): Mono is able to take advantage of it.
-   s390x peephole optimizations.
-   Instruction selector is able to pick best instructions on specific processors.
